Happy Helpers is an application developed with the sole objective of providing a helping hand to people in need through the means of the internet. In these dire circumstances of a pandemic, there are many individuals requiring assistance, and there are many who wish to help. Happy Helpers bridges this gap by connecting donees (those in need) to donors (those willing to help), acting as an intermediary to facilitate and streamline the process.
